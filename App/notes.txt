flag edit: GUI options for all known flags
-tooltips for each flag
-converts options to raw savedata when writing to file (caches until next write?)

dropdown menus:
-file menu: load, save, export
-options menu: save file path, etc.



3 classes:
-App: Main setup
-Interface: GUI
-Editor: Savefile management


todo:
-design GUI
-design hlds format
-implement everything


!!! design changes
save vs save as

have a separate file format (savedata, .hlds) for editing that removes the machine specific header and minimises read/write costs
only store local prefix, share these files instead of savefiles

can load/save hlds, import hlds from .sav, write hlds to save 0/1/2/3

construct Savedata from either hlds or by parsing .sav



app passes itself + editor intsance to interface for use with callbacks
editor deals with savedata, app deals with settings i.e. changing savefile path
